# puppet module

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/spiette/puppet-puppet.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/spiette/puppet-puppet)

This is a puppet module. It is meant to be used on nodes as well as puppetmasters. Current feature set:

* Debian and RedHat family supported
* Always enable the client
* Configure a CA or non-CA puppetmaster
* Works with passenger or with puppetmaster standalone
* Works well with puppetlabs/puppetdb modules
* agent_options and master_options hash to set arbitrary options to agent and master

The puppetmaster with passenger uses puppetlabs package, which means that it is not as robust as a pure puppet-based recipe.

# Synopsis

Except for configuration parameters, only the top puppet class should invoked. Use the `master` parameter to enable the puppetmaster.

## puppet class

### Parameters

- *certname*
  Same as puppet configuration parameter. Set the certificate name that the puppetmaster will see and, if applicable, the puppetmaster will have.

- *server*
  Same as puppet configuration parameter. Server used by the puppet agent. 

- *master*
  Boolean, false by default. If true, the node will be configured as a puppetmaster.

- *passenger*
  If passenger (and master) is true, the puppetmaster will have Apache and passenger in frontend. Use this if you want to serve more than a couple of nodes.

- *autosign*
  Same as puppet configuration parameter. Use this for automated testing.

- *puppetdb*
  If true, it will set the proper storeconfig configuration. It wil _not_ set puppetdb, use puppetlabs module for that.

- *ca*
  Used by a puppetmaster to set it as the CA or not.

- *ca_server*
  Used by the agent for certificate management. See http://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/scaling_multiple_masters.html for more details.

- *master_options*
  Hash used to add any additionnal configuration settings for the master. See http://docs.puppetlabs.com/references/latest/configuration.html

- *agent_options*
  Hash used to add any additionnal configuration settings for the agent. See http://docs.puppetlabs.com/references/latest/configuration.html

# Usage

### For puppet agents

    class { 'puppet':
      certname => 'puppet.local.lan',
      server   => 'puppet.local.lan',
      agent_options => {
        'runinterval => '900',
        'splay' => true,
      }
    }

### For puppet server, using webrick. The fqdn is not the certname of the puppetmaster.

    $servername = 'puppet.local.lan'
    host { $::fqdn:
      ip           => $::ipaddress_eth0,
      host_aliases => [ $::hostname, $servername ],
    }
    class { 'puppet':
      master    => true,
      certname  => $servername,
      passenger => false,
      agent_options => {
        'runinterval => '900',
        'splay' => true,
      }
      master_options => {
        # set directory environments, set 'manifest' and 'modulepath' configuration directive
        # in $confdir/environments/<environment>/environment.conf
        # manifest = manifests
        # modulepath = modules:manifests
        environmentpath => '$confdir/environments'
      }
    }

### For puppet server, using passenger. The fqdn is not the certname of the puppetmaster.

    $servername = 'puppet.local.lan'
    host { $::fqdn:
      ip           => $::ipaddress_eth0,
      host_aliases => [ $::hostname, $servername ],
    }
    class { 'puppet':
      certname  => $servername,
      master    => true,
      passenger => true,
    }

### How to use with puppetdb

See in tests/puppetmaster-puppetdb.pp. This role should bootstrap a puppetmaster with puppetdb.
